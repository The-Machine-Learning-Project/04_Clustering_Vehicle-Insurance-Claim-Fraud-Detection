# Vehicle Insurance Claim Fraud Detection

## Project Description
> According to the Insurance Information Institute (III), insurance fraud is a deception committed against an insurance company for financial gain. It can be anything from lying about a garaging address (the location where your vehicle is parked for most of the year) to exaggerating an accident to outright staging one. Fraudulent claims are extremely difficult to detect causing immense losses on the part of the insurance company. <br>

> This project delves into the application of clustering as a tool for anomaly detection in the insurance industry, aiming to address and mitigate the impact of such deceptive practices.
